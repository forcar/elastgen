# elastgen
c     This program makes ntuples and BOS event files for (e,e'p) elastic scattering
c     with the elastic peak modified by vertex corrections according to the Mo-Tsai 
c     formula (II.6) and internal bremmstrahlung (radiative tails) calculated from 
c     a Monte-Carlo sampling of formula (B.4) and (B.5) from RMP, Vol. 41, 205 (1969).
